## Evo Rules

_Evo is a game of actual evolution. Creatures evolve over time by successfully passing on genes, not players making informed choices. All current games about evolution are actually intelligent design simulators. Players act as gods shaping their species journey through the ages. It might look like evolution, but only abstractly. Evo aims to change that by having players instead competing to make creatures survive. Creatures that survive pass on their genes to their offspring, and those creatures that don’t see their genes perish. Over the eons species will adapt to the world and change, but not because players designed their dna. Instead they will change to survive, like all species do. The player who was the most successful at survival will be the victor, not the player who most intelligently crafted their species._


## Summary

A humble creature has seen its population divided by natural causes. Their genome isolated by distance, each population forms their own species and must now fight for survival. Competing for food and a chance to pass along one’s genes is the goal of any species. Players play as various species through the game attempting to pass along as many genes as possible each round. Players who are most successful at leaving their genetic fingerprints on the future will be victorious.

## Setup



1. **Prepare common supply**
    1. Separate each Trait card by type and place in face up piles
    2. Shuffle the Fauna, Flora, and Adaptation cards and place in separate face down piles. If any of these piles ever run out, shuffle their respective discard piles and form a new deck.
2. **Setup Species**
    3. Each player takes 2 of each Trait Card and shuffles the cards into a _Trait Deck_ placing it face down in front of them
    4. Each player draws 2 random Adaptation cards placing them face up in front of them
    5. Each player takes all of the tokens corresponding to one species
    6. Players draw 6 Trait cards from their species’ trait deck
    7. Each species also has one face up pile of cards known as the _Future Genome_ and one face down pile of cards known as the _Lost Genome._ Both piles start the game empty
3. **Setup Locations**
    8. Each player randomly selects a location board and places it in the middle of the table
    9. Deal 3 Fauna Cards and 2 Flora cards to each location placing them face up in the designated spaces.
    10. Each player places 3 of their selected species’ Population Tokens on the location board they selected
4. **Randomly select a starting player to begin the first _Generation _of the First _Millennia_**


## Game Overview

Evo is played over a series of 4 rounds called _Millennia_. Each Millennia, players will play a series of turns called _Generations_. Each generation, players will draw at least 6 cards from their deck and attempt to use them to gather food and survive to successfully pass along their species’ genes. 

Each trait not used during a generation is discarded and lost from the gene pool. Each card used represents that trait successfully being passed onto future generations. Players score points for efficiently using all of their cards each generation and successfully passing along more traits.

Each generation a player will choose one of the population tokens in play as their active token and attempt to pass along as many of that population’s traits. Once they’ve used a population token in a millennia, they may not select the same population again.

Once a player has finished a generation, the next player completes their generation. Once all players have completed all generations in a round, the millennia ends and time rolls forward.

 \
Between Millennia species and the world will undergo changes based on what happened before, challenging species with an ever changing landscape to compete in. Once all millennia are complete, the player who was most successful in passing along genes through the game has won.


## Species Overview

A player will play one species each millennia. Between millennia though, the species a player is using may change hands. Players could potentially play all species through the course of the game. 

Species’ genomes are represented by a deck of Trait cards that in total describe the innate natural characteristics of that species. The more of a given trait in that species’ deck, the stronger those traits are represented in their genome. Successfully using traits to survive will cause those genes to pass on to future millennia. For example, using size to hunt a fauna, will cause a genome to bias towards more size genes in future millennia.

Species are represented in the world by population tokens. At the start of the game, all of a Species population is isolated to one location, but species can migrate between locations in search of more favorable conditions. These migrations could cause them to bump into their distant ancestors, potentially rising to conflict as the hunt for scarce resources is fierce.


## Survival and Food

In order to have a chance of passing along your genes, a species must first eat. In Evo, a species that is able to successfully find food is able to survive and pass along its genes. A species that can’t find food to survive will see it’s genes lost to time. All creatures in Evo are omnivorous and eat whatever they are able to. Players will create sets of cards from their hand to successfully hunt and forage for food. Each successful population will see it’s genes shape future generations.


## One Generation

Using the trait cards in your hand, and the adaptations of your current species, you will attempt to collect as much food as possible for your species and propel as many of your traits forward as you can. You will play one entire generation before play passes to the next player. During a generation you may take any number of actions so long as you have the cards to do so.

To begin a generation, select one of your species’ available Population Tokens. This will be the _Active Population_ this generation. Then using that population token, perform as many of the following actions as you can.



* Hunt Fauna
* Forage Flora
* Migrate
* Hunt Species


##### (Terminology) _A Future Generation_

Cards and rules will often refer to _A Future Generation_ as any cards still remaining in this current species’ Trait Deck for **this millennia**. If a species Trait Deck is empty, there is **no** Future Generation this millennia and abilities referencing it do not take effect.


#### Using Adaptations

Adaptations add active and passive abilities to a species that allow it to use it’s traits in unique and creative ways. At any time during an active generation, adaptations may modify the available action costs or effects. Reference each card for full details. 

When you use the effect of an Adaptation, that adaptation’s presence in the genome is reinforced. Each time you take an action that uses an adaptation’s effect, add a survival token to the adaption’s card. At the end of the millennia, adaptations that have not been frequently used may be culled from the genome.


### Hunt Fauna

Hunt for prey in your current location. Find a target and overcome their defenses to claim your survival.



1. **The Hunt**: Choose a Fauna Card in the same location as the _Active Population_ and play cards from your hand matching the symbols shown on the card. 
2. **The Catch**: Place **two** of this species’ survival tokens on the Fauna Card to mark it has been hunted successfully (plus one survival token to any adaptations you used to take this action).
3. **Macroevolution**: This population has proven that these traits are viable! Place all played cards face up in the _Future Genome_ pile for the current species.
4. **Microevolution**: The population was also successful in producing offspring this millennia!  
    1. If there **is **a future generation, collect one Trait Card matching the **fauna’s **Primary Trait from the common supply and place it face up on top of this species’ Trait Deck.
    2. If there **is not** a future generation, instead place one additional survival Token on this Fauna to mark an exceptionally bountiful Hunt.


### Forage Flora

Search the location for plants you can gorge on. A flora’s location board plays a role in deciding what is required to find the food successfully.



1. **The Search**: Choose a Flora Card in the same location as the _Active Population_ and play a Trait Cards from your hand matching **the location’s** Primary type. 
2. **The Gather**: Additionally, you must play at least one Trait matching **the Flora’s** Primary Type. You may play any number of trait cards that match.
3. **The Gorge:** For **each **Trait played during **the gather**, place one of this species’ Survival Tokens on this flora card to mark it has been foraged successfully.
4. **Macroevolution:** This population has proven that these traits are viable to find food. Place all played cards face up in the _Future Genome_ pile for the current species.
5. **Microevolution:** The trait used to search for food has been passed onto offspring.
    1. If there **is **a future generation, collect one Trait Cards from the common supply matching this **Location’s** Primary Trait and place it face up on top of this species’ Trait Deck.
    2. If there **is not **a future generation, instead place one additional survival Token on this Flora to mark an exceptionally bountiful forage.


### Migrate

Sometimes a species will need to move to more favorable habitats in order to thrive. You may move the _Active Population_ to another location by setting out on a journey. You may only Migrate while there **is **a future generation.



1. **The Choice: **Choose any two trait cards from your hand.
2. **The Journey: **Pick one of those two cards at random and place it _face up_ on top of the species’ Trait Deck. Place the unselected card _face down _on that species’ _Lost Generation_ pile. Sadly not all of the traits will survive the journey.
3. **The Arrival: **Move the _Active Population_ to any other location.


### Hunt Species

_Tbd_


### The end of a Generation

Once you can no longer take any actions, the generation ends. To prepare for the next generation follow these steps.



1. Turn the _Active Population_ token on it’s side to denote it is no longer available this millennia. 
2. Place any remaining cards from your hand face down in this species’ _Lost Genome_ pile. These traits were not successfully passed on to future generations and will be lost at the end of the millennia.
3. If there is a future generation, prepare by drawing all face up cards from this species’ Trait Deck. Then, draw 6 **additional** cards. You will always draw **all **of face up offspring from the future generation before drawing your 6 normal Traits.

Once you’ve prepared for the next generation (if any), play passes to the player on your left.


### The end of a Millennia

Once all players have played their last generation this millennia, the door closes on this time period. Locations and species will change as time rolls forward. Fauna and flora may go extinct, and new ones will rise to take their place. Species will gain new adaptations and traits. 

Players will work together to score the previous round prepare for the next millennia.



1. **Prepare Locations**
    1. **Fauna Extinction: **Any Fauna with survival tokens exceeding 5 + the current Millennia have been hunted to extinction. Discard them and replace them with a new Fauna from the deck. **All** survival tokens on this fauna are returned to the supply without effect.
    2. **Flora Extinction: **Any Flora with survival tokens exceeding 5 + the current Millennia have been foraged to extinction. Discard them and replace them with a new Fauna from the deck. **All** survival tokens on this flora are returned to the supply without effect.
    3. **Thriving Competitors:** Any Fauna or Flora card with zero survival tokens on it has been unchallenged in its location and begins to outcompete local competitors.
        1. For **each **thriving competitor at a location, return to the supply one survival token from **each **species there with no effect. _(e.g. If there are 2 thriving competitors at a location, each species with any survival tokens at that location discard 2 tokens)_
    4. **Successful Populations:** Each player returns any remaining survival tokens left from all locations matching the species that played this millennia and scores 1 point per token. In additional, score bonus points according to the below table:
* 1-5 tokens: 0 Points
* 6-10 tokens: 3 Points
* 11+ tokens: 7 Points
2. **Prepare Species**
    5. **Future Genome: **Each Player counts the cards from the _Future Genome_ pile for the species they played. Reference the following chart to determine target number of Trait Cards:
* End of millennia 1: 24 Cards
* End of millennia 2: 30 Cards
* End of millennia 3: 36 Cards
* End of millennia 4: 42 Cards
        2. If you are **below** the target number of cards, randomly select trait cards from the supply and add them to the Future Genome until it matches. **Lose 1 Point** for each card added this way.
        3. If you are **above** the target number of cards, randomly return trait cards from the Future Genome to the supply until it matches. **Gain 1 Point** for each card removed this way.
        4. Now that the deck contains traits equal to the target count above, Shuffle it and place it face down to form the genome for the next millennia _(skip this during the last millennia of the game)_
    6. **Natural Selection:** Discard the adaptation with the least survival tokens on it. Choose at random in the case of ties. Return all survival tokens on Adaptations to the supply.
    7. **Random Mutation:** Draw two new adaptations and add them to the species’ available adaptations _(The total will go up by 1 each millennia)._
    8. **A New Age: **Return all unavailable species’ population to standing to mark them available for the new millennia.
3. **Species Selection _(Millennia 1-3 only)_**
    9. In order from least to most points, players take turns selecting which species to play next millennia. It is possible to play the same species in back to back millennia.
    10. When you select your species from the round, take one of the reserved Population Tokens for that species from the supply and add it to any location with one of that species’ population already present.
    11. Then, you _may_ move one of your new species’ Population Tokens from any location to any other location. This move does not have any associated cost and does **not** trigger any migration effects.
    12. After adding new population and optionally migrating, collect all the Traits, Adaptations, and tokens associated with that species in front of you and draw 6 cards to prepare for the next generation.
4. **Play continues with the player with the most points starting the first generation of the next millennia.**


## End of the Game

After totalling points from the Future Genome in the 4th Millennia, the game ends and players compare total points. The player with the most points wins. Ties share the victory.
